### Definitions

When discussing the Big Five, there are several bits of terminology that needs to be understood: 

**Trait**: “Person’s typical style of thinking, feeling, and acting in different kinds of situations and at different times”  (Costa and McCrae 1988). Traits can be used to predict certain behaviors. 

**Personality**: “Pattern of relatively permanent traits and unique characteristics that give both consistency and individuality to a person’s behavior.” They’re acquired through life experiences and are relatively stable. 

**Temperament**: “Physical, mental, and emotional traits people are born with.”

Many consider temperament as a subset of personality. However, temperament often has their own model, with different traits. This model is called the CBQ (Children’s Behavior Questionnaire) and the three traits are: 

- Negative Affectivity (Neuroticism)
- Surgency Extraversion (Extroversion)
- Effortful Control (Conscientiousness) 

Notice the overlap between the two - we’re only missing openness and agreeableness. However, despite the similarities, it should be acknowledged that the Big Five aims to cover personality traits, while integrating temperament into the mix. 

While we’re talking about definitions, I should also clarify extroversion. The Big Five uses Eysenck’s concept of extroversion rather than Jung’s. 

**Eysenck:** Extroverts gain and recharge their mental energy from external stimuli, such as social interaction. Introverts prefer to shield themselves from external stimuli and recharge their mental energy through withdrawing themselves. 

**Jung:** Extroverts seek action and sensory input from the external world, using their experiences to influence themselves. Introverts immerse themselves in their internal environment, through reflection, dreaming, and understanding [themselves]. 

This clarification may be redundant -- many people have only heard of Eysenck’s version of extroversion, as society tends to use his version as the ‘only’ version. However, I still find value in acknowledging Jung’s definition, especially because Eynsenck built his off of Jung’s. 


### Big Five Personality Test - Origins  

“Can you find a taxonomy to describe human personality?” 

That’s the idea that started the Big Five Personality Test. We wanted to understand human personality and map it out qualitatively. We needed to use the power of science to obtain even more knowledge! 

Scientists have been interested in personality since the 1880s, with the first official study of personality done by Gordon Allport and Henry Odbert in 1936. First, they gathered 18000 
personality-describing words from the Webster’s Dictionary. Then, using this list, found 4504 adjectives to describe non-physical characters, creating the first ‘personality wordbank’. 

Then, in 1943, Raymond Cattel reduced this wordbank to ~160 traits, removing any words with similar meanings. He proceeded to add 22 more words to describe “interest” and “abilities”, then created “personality cultures” to group these words. By 1948, he narrowed it down to 36 terms with 12 personality cultures. 

In 1947, Eysenck introduced his book “Dimensions of Personality”, creating his own version of “Extraversion” and coining the term “Neuroticism”.

In 1949, Donald Fiske takes 22 terms from Cattell’s study, and creates give main categories: "Social Adaptability", "Emotional Control", "Conformity", "Inquiring Intellect", and "Confident Self-expression". This is the beginning of the Big Five test. 

Although this test has undergone several revisions and expansions from various other researchers (i.e. Norman (1967), Smith (1967), McCrae and Costa (1987), and more), the purpose and ideas within the test remain. 

### Strengths 

There’s a lot of reasons why the Big Five is such a popular test and remains at the forefront of personality research. 

1. The traits the Big Five measures are relatively stable during adulthood. 

As we grow older, our traits are going to naturally develop and change. For example, as you get older, you tend to have higher conscientiousness and agreeableness and lower neuroticism, extroversion, and openness. This is mainly because people tend to have more responsibilities (i.e. family, job, etc.) as they age, and eventually learn to build traits to adapt. This is called the maturation effect. 

However, after adolescence, people’s traits tend to stabilize, ensuring there are distinct behavior patterns to analyze. This consistency (leading to replicability) is desirable for scientists. 

2. Widely accepted by the scientific community 
Many scientists have conducted studies to confirm the validity and reliability of the Big Five Personality Test. This includes Satow, 2021 and Kamarulzaman and Nordin, 2012). Using confirmatory factor analysis, invariance analysis, and various other empirical tests, the Big Five test is considered to be validated and reliable, and is now the most widely accepted test within this niche. 

3. Very easily repeatable 
Scientists value repeatability. Got a fascinating result? Make sure to do the experiment 2 more times, just in case something was off! 

The Big Five test is easily repeatable, as it’s generally delivered as a 50-question Likert scale test. It can easily be printed and distributed to thousands of participants, ensuring consistency between studies. 

4. Simplicity and Generalization’
As a result of constantly improving the Big Five personality test, the traits we’ve selected are 

a) Easy to understand and specific - Traits are clearly defined and simple
b) Mutually exclusive - Makes it easy to quantify 
c) Generalizable - These traits are universal and can apply to any culture

Together, these strengths make the Big Five the default when considering personality. 

### Applications in Society 

You can apply the Big Five personality traits to predict future behavior.  

A popular example is that high conscientiousness and emotional stability (low neuroticism) are correlated with strong job performance and higher wages. This information could potentially shape businesses’ hiring and recruiting practices, as they’re already begun to use the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to better understand candidates and narrow down the applicant pool. 

This has the potential to be a positive addition: Bad hires can cost “up to 30% of the employee’s first-year earnings” - a significant loss for the business if “46% of newly-hired employees [are] deemed failures”. However, since the Big Five personality test is a self-assessment, lying on it becomes a trivial task. 

High conscientiousness is also a general indicator for superior academic performance. This is likely because conscientiousness and agreeableness were “positively related with all four learning styles (synthesis analysis, methodical study, fact retention, and elaborative processing)”. It was also concluded that the Big Five “explained 14% of the variance in [a student’s] grade point average” whereas “learning systems explained an additional 3%”, establishing a clear connection between personality traits and learning styles improving one’s academics. 

Certain traits can also correlate with specific learning styles.


### Limitations 

### Possible Improvements 

### Spin-off Tests (Two Factor, HEXACO, Ten Factor)

### Connections to MBTI 



Origins: 
“It all stemmed from the idea of: can you find a taxonomy to describe human personality?”
Trying to find empirical research 
At first, just chose words that described “conspicuous aspects of the character”, but later has been refined 
 Robert McCrae and Paul Costa in the ‘80s and ‘90s. Is where it now stems from 

Used eysenck’s concept of extroversion rather than jung’s 
Jung: an extrovert seeks intensive contact with the outside world seeking action and sensory input. An introvert instead focuses their energy internally, on reflection, dreaming and understanding.
Eysenck’s:  they gain and recharge their mental energy. By nature, introverted people have a higher level of brain activity and therefore feel a greater need to shield themselves from external stimuli. 
Each has 6 different subtraits 

Strengths of Big Five 
Stay relatively stable during adulthood 
Conscientiousness and agreeable increase, with neutocism, extraversion, and openness decrease with age
Predictable based on life’s responibiltiies, called “maturation effect” 
Accepted as a pretty empirical framework in the scientific world 
Lots of validity (various tests that are very imperical) 
Most widely accepted 
Very easily repeatable 
Broad scope of traits, and generalizatin gpersonality traits cross-culture and environments
Mutually exclusive 


Limitations of the Big Five Personality Test

Although this test samples hundreds of locations, it’s not completely representative of the population it claims to show. 

Notice that a majority of our responses come from western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WIRED) populations, with less developed countries (such as the ones in Africa) often have a lot less. 

Not only that, but the Big Five doesnt seem to have the same results when testing non-WIRED popualtiosn. Iot showed that conscientiousness doesn’t correlate with income (10/14 countries) and extraversion and agreeabless also show a negative correlation. On the other hand, emotional stability and opness show more of a positive correlation. 
People care more about cognitive ability 

Other tests also show that there’s a correlation between extraoversion and job performance, or there is just no correlation. 
These results vary a lot (in relation to performance) -> not as standarized as people think 


Onlyu 25% fo respondents in these severys have college education, compared to 81% of internet data 

Cognitive ability can affect people’s ability of abstract Big Five questions. 
People often mmisplace items. 
Basically only emotional stability shoudl be correlated with income 
Strangely, openness also seems to be an income 
Could be a result of biases

Need to develop better udnerstaning of developmental countries to measure specific personality traits 

Openness is a little bit funny, since different genders actually interpret it differently
Males were more e “imaginative” and “inquisitive”, even more specifically for the patriarchal cutlureal context in Turkey, where there are veys trict gender roles 
Males are encouraged to pursue what they want, while women are often shoved into a hole of what they should do instead, and monitored to be socailized into a rule-abidng lifestyle 
This is less prevalent in WIRED societies 
In addition, openness is kinda varied, and can signify be impacted by culture, does this matter? Is that still the reason person? Is it what they truly think, or were they just taught to think that?  
Motivation, have varied experiences, rqeuies a vision and aestehticen sentivity and a willingness not abondnet traditions, so it might have different meaning in cultural contexts. 
This is also impacted in China, where Openness doesn’t appear ince the Chinese Personality Assessment Inventory, as it’s a far more western-centric trait, rather than collectivist cultures. 
For example, women consistently report higher Neuroticism, Agreeableness, warmth (an extraversion facet) and openness to feelings, and men often report higher assertiveness (a facet of extraversion) and openness to ideas as assessed by the NEO-PI-R.[153]
That is, men in highly developed world regions were less neurotic, less extraverted, less conscientious and less agreeable compared to men in less developed world regions. 
Women didnt’ change 

Do males need more resources? Women’s natural deposition is more stable than men’s? Evolutionary pressures, 

Failure on the Test’s end, do we need to test it in more varied contests? 

Ignore spirituality and religioucity
Essential component of every culture and greatly influences behaviour  
Relicioustiy is shown to correlate with agreeableness and concicenciousness
Also neutocism sometimes(?) 

Religion can’t just be considered as ‘social attitudes’ and should be reated as another trait (refer back to definition of personality?)
Six subtrats, relicious faith, commitment, self-transendence 
Icnreidbly important in Arab adn Islamic personlitieis/states, as they’re intertwined with their being, and likely should be considered when trying to describe who one is 

Etic Approach: Traits are universal regalrdess of environment, culture or context
Emic = culture specific 
Etic is too simplicitse, as everybody is teh same liek chemical elements and does not account for human diversity (which is wider than biological diversity) 
Man’s last resort when in different circumstances 

People use different questions with different amount of questiosn -> how can this lead to standarized measurement (44 items, 25 items, etc.)

Argument about 
Manipulestness, honestly, seductiveness, thrifitness, humor. Humility 

Humility subtraits: Facets: Sincerity, Fairness, Greed Avoidance, Modesty
Low levels of the Honesty-Humility factor are associated with greater levels of materialism, unethical business practices and deviant sexual behavior.
Associated with dark triad

Lexical hypothesis and how does that affect 
Positive and negative affects how someone interpreits 
Basically social and negativity bias -> how someone interpretes it is going to skew ther result 

What even is personality 
“pattern of r elatively permanent traits and unique characteristics that give both consistency and individuality to a person’s behaviour.”
Gives us individuality and differences in chevaour, consistently of behavioirity. 

Trait: 
person’s typical style of thinking,feeling, and acting in different kinds of situ-ations and at different times” and each traitis  a  personality  dimension  which  repre-sents a most essential way in which peoplevary (Costa and McCrae 1988)
Stable over time and differen stiatuions
Avaliaibiltiy of trait helps predict certain bevhaiours 

Temperament: biologically based differences? 
The question is that is temperament apart of personality 
Models of temperament often include four trait dimensions: surgency/sociability, negative emotionality, persistence/effortful control, and activity level.

Correlation with Society 
Conscienticousness and emotionally stasbility are strong predictors of job performance and wages 
Personality traits are pretty important for people with lower levels fo job complexity or education level 
Valid self reporting tool, can be used to enhance academic acahievement to tailor teching methods to individuals in school settings 

This is incredibly important as people have started turning to personality tests within job interviews, with the popularity of tests like MBTI 
According to Undercover Recruiter, the cost of a bad hire can reach up to 30% of the employee's first-year earnings. Leadership IQ found that 46% of newly-hired employees will be deemed failures within 18 months after starting.
But, this can easily be gamed (already happens unintentionally with social desirability bias)  
. Social desirability bias, for instance, could help explain why Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are the most problematic PTs and why Conscientiousness has little predictive power in the survey data. 
Also associated with: 
Acedmic performance
Sense of coherence
Job burnout 
Psychotism in youth 

Knockoff tests
Developed due to the failures or oversights of the current model 
Big two traits -> Plasticity (extraversion and openness) and Stability (neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) — show that Plasticity has a more robust and stronger association with creativity than Stability
Also extraversion and anxiety (Wiggins) 
Three factor model 
Psychoticsm 
Extraversion And neuroticism 
Four factor 
Agreeablness, neuroticism, conscienticousness, culture-intellicet (wider than openness to experience) 
Other big five traits 
sincerity, excitement, compe-tence, sophistication, and ruggedness
Big six traits (HEXACO)
 Honesty-Humility (H), Emotionality (E), Extraversion (X), Agreeableness (A), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness to Experience (O).
Big seven traits
positive emotionality, negative emotionality, dependability, agreeability, conventionality, positive valence, and negative valence.
Adjustment, ambition, sociability, likeability, prudence, intellectance, and school success 
Big ten traits (jordan peterson) 
Conscientiousness is about Industriousness and Orderliness
Agreeableness is about Politeness and Compassion
Neuroticism is about Withdrawal and Volatility
Openness to Experience is about Intellect and “Openness” proper
Extraversion is about Assertiveness and Enthusiasm

Also has lead to: Psychopathology Five (PSY-5), (Harkness et al. 2002), Alternative Five-Factor Model (2012), and Chinese Person-ality  Assessment  Inventory  (CPAI)

CPAI
Harmony, Ren Qing (relationship orientation), modernization, thrift, Ah-Q mentality (defensiveness), graciousness, trustworthiness, face, family orientation, and somatization (expression of distress)
big four traits: Dependability, Chinese Tradition, Social Potency, Individualism

Pscyhopathy Five 
Aggressiveness, psychoticism, disconstraint, negative emotionality/ neuroticism, introversion/low positive emotionality
Psychopathology 

Alternative 
Impulsive sensation seeking, aggression-hostility, activity, sociability, neuroticism-anxiety


Other uses of Big Five
Alzheimers -> decrease in conscientiousness, and icnreqse in nuetoricms, crease in extraversion, openness, and agreeableness 

Drug users 
Heroion = High N, O, Down A, C
Ecstacy = High E, O, Lower, A, C

Mental disorders re just linked ot neurociism (development), conscienticousness and is the strongest personaltiy predictr of reduced morality, makes bad health choices. Also low extroversion. No disorders associated with openness. Neutocism is also shown to have worse health outcomes. 

Can affect teaching styles(?) 
Openness 

HEXACO vs Big Five 
Big five has limited ability to identify dark traid (psychologay, narcissism, and machiavellianism) 
Overlap with agreeableness and emotionallity between two tests 
They define subtarits slightly differently, affecting intererpation, and offers ‘better description’
